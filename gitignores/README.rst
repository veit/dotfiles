A collection of ``.gitignore`` templates
========================================

Folder structure
----------------

The templates are organised as follows:

* the root folder contains templates in common use
* `global <./global>`_ contains templates for various editors, tools and
  operating systems. It is recommended that you add these to your global
  template with the following command in your terminal::

    $ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore

Explicit repository excludes
----------------------------

If you donâ€™t want to share a ``.gitignore`` file with others, you can edit the
file ``.git/info/exclude`` within the root of your Git repository.
